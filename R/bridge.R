#' Bridge Centrality
#'
#' Calculates bridge centrality metrics (bridge strength, bridge betweenness, bridge closeness, and bridge expected influence)
#' given a network and a prespecified set of communities.
#'
#' To plot the results, first save as an object, and then use plot() (see ?plot.bridge)
#'
#' @param network a network of class "igraph", "qgraph", or an adjacency matrix representing
#' a network
#' @param communities an object of class "communities" (igraph) OR a character vector of
#' community  assignments for each node (e.g., c("Comm1", "Comm1", "Comm2", "Comm2)).
#' The ordering of this vector should correspond to the vector from argument "nodes".
#' Can also be in list format (e.g., list("Comm1"=c(1:10), "Comm2"=c(11:20)))
#' @param useCommunities character vector specifying which communities should be included. Default set to "all"
#' @param directed logical. Directedness is automatically detected if set to "NULL" (the default).
#' Symmetric adjacency matrices will be undirected, asymmetric matrices will be directed
#' @param nodes a vector containing the names of the nodes. If set to "NULL", this vector will
#' be automatically detected in the order extracted
#' @param normalize logical. Bridge centralities are divided by their highest possible value (assuming max edge strength=1)
#' in order to normalize by different community sizes
#'
#' @details
#'
#' Centrality metrics (strength, betweenness, etc.) illuminate how nodes are interconnected
#' among the entire network. However, sometimes we are interested in the connectivity
#' \emph{between specific communities} in a larger network. Nodes that are important in communication
#' between communities can be conceptualized as bridge nodes.
#'
#' Bridge centrality statistics aim to identify bridge nodes. Bridge centralities
#' can be calculated across all communities, or between a specific subset of communities (as
#' identified by the \code{useCommunities} argument)
#'
#' The bridge() function currently returns 5 centrality metrics: 1) bridge strength,
#' 2) bridge betweenness, 3) bridge closeness, 4) bridge expected influence (1-step), and
#' 5) bridge expected influence (2-step)
#'
#' See ?plot.bridge for plotting details.
#'
#' Bridge strength is defined as the sum of the absolute value of all edges that exist between a
#' node A and all nodes that are not in the same community as node A. In a directed network, bridge strength can be
#' separated into bridge in-degree and bridge out-degree.
#'
#' Bridge betweenness is defined as the number of times a node B lies on the shortest path between
#' nodes A and C, where nodes A and C come from different communities.
#'
#' Bridge closeness is defined as the inverse of the average length of the path from a node A to all nodes that are
#' not in the same community as node A.
#'
#' Bridge expected influence (1-step) is defined as the sum of the value (+ or -) of all edges that
#' exist between a node A and all nodes that are not in the same community as node A. In a directed network, expected influence
#' only considers edges extending from the given node (e.g., out-degree)
#'
#' Bridge expected influence (2-step) is similar to 1-step, but also considers the indirect effect that a node A may have
#' on other communities through other nodes (e.g, an indirect effect on node C as in A -> B -> C).
#' Indirect effects are weighted by the first edge weight (e.g., A -> B), and then added to the 1-step expected influence.
#' Indirect effects back on node A's own community (A -> B -> A) are not counted.
#'
#' If negative edges exist, bridge expected influence should be used. Bridge closeness and bridge betweenness are only defined
#' for positive edge weights, thus negative edges, if present, are deleted in the calculation of these metrics. Bridge strength
#' uses the absolute value of edge weights.
#'
#' @examples
#' \donttest{
#' graph1 <- qgraph::qgraph(cor(depression))
#'
#' b <- bridge(graph1, communities=c('1','1','2','2','2','2','1','2','1'))
#' b
#'
#'}
#' @return \code{\link{bridge}} returns a list of class "\code{bridge}" which contains:
#'
#'$'Bridge Strength'
#'
#'$'Bridge Betweenness'
#'
#'$'Bridge Closeness'
#'
#'$'Bridge Expected Influence (1-step)'
#'
#'$'Bridge Expected Influence (2-step)'
#'
#'Each of these contains a vector of named centrality values
#'
#'$'communities' is also returned, which returns the communities in vector format. If communities were supplied as a list or igraph object, it is advised that one check the accuracy of this vector.
