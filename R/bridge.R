#' Bridge Centrality
#'
#' Calculates bridge centrality metrics (bridge strength, bridge betweenness, bridge closeness, and bridge expected influence)
#' given a network and a prespecified set of communities.
#'
#' To plot the results, first save as an object, and then use plot() (see ?plot.bridge)
#'
#' @param network a network of class "igraph", "qgraph", or an adjacency matrix representing
#' a network
#' @param communities an object of class "communities" (igraph) OR a characcter vector of
#' community  assignments for each node (e.g., c("Comm1", "Comm1", "Comm2", "Comm2)).
#' The ordering of this vector should correspond to the vector from argument "nodes"
#' @param useCommunities character vector specifying which communities should be included. Default set to "all"
#' @param directed logical. Directedness is automatically detected if set to "NULL" (the default).
#' Symmetric adjacency matrices will be undirected, unsymmetric matrices will be directed
#' @param nodes a vector containing the names of the nodes. If set to "NULL", this vector will
#' be automatically detected in the order extracted
#'
#' @details
#'
#' Centrality metrics (strength, betweenness, etc.) illuminate how nodes are interconnected
#' among the entire network. However, sometimes we are interested in the connectivity
#' \emph{between specific communities} in a larger network. Nodes that are important in communication
#' between communities can be conceptualized as bridge nodes.
#'
#' Bridge centrality statistics aim to identify bridge nodes. Bridge centralities
#' can be calculated across all communities, or between a specific subset of coumminities (as
#' identified by the \code{useCommunities} argument)
#'
#' The bridge() function currently returns 5 centrality metrics: 1) bridge strength,
#' 2) bridge betweenness, 3) bridge closeness, 4) bridge expected influence (1-step), and
#' 5) bridge expected influence (2-step)
#'
#' Bridge strength is defined as the sum of the absolute value of all edges that exist between a
#' node A and all nodes that are not in the same community as node A. In a directed network, bridge strength can be
#' separated into bridge in-degree and bridge out-degree.
#'
#' Bridge betweenness is defined as the number of times a node B lies on the shortest path between
#' nodes A and C, where nodes A and C come from different communities.
#'
#' Bridge closeness is defined as the average length of the path from a node A to all nodes that are
#' not in the same community as node A
#'
#' Bridge expected influence (1-step) is defined as the sum of the value (+ or -) of all edges that
#' exist between a node A and all nodes that are not in the same community as node A. In a directed network, expected influence
#' only considers edges extending from the given node (e.g., out-degree)
#'
#' Bridge expected influence (2-step) is similar to 1-step, but also considers the indirect effect that a node A may have
#' through other nodes (e.g, an indirect effect on node C as in A -> B -> C).
#' Indirect effects are weighted by the first edge weight (e.g., A -> B), and then added to the 1-step expected influence
#'
#' If negative edges exist, bridge expected influence should be used. Any negative edges are currently ignored in the
#' algorithms to compute bridge betweenness and bridge closeness.
