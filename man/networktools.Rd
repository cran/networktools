\description{
Tools for Identifying Important Nodes in Networks
}
\details{
Includes assorted tools for network analysis. Bridge centrality (\code{bridge()})
calculates the extent to which nodes act as important communication points between
predefined community structures. The \code{goldbricker()} and \code{net_reduce()} functions
are tools for dealing with redundant nodes. For plotting networks, see \code{MDSnet()},
\code{PCAnet()}, and \code{EIGENnet()}.
