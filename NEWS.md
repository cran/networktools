# networktools 1.0.0

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.

# networktools 1.1.0

* The bridge() function is now available. Can be used to calculate and plot "bridge statistics", 
  including bridge strength, bridge betweenness, bridge closeness, and bridge expected influence.
  
# networktools 1.1.1

* Bug fixes for bridge strength in the bridge() function
* The goldbricker() and net_reduce() functions are now available. Useful for comparing correlations 
  in order to eliminate nodes in networks which ostensibly measure the same construct

# networktools 1.1.2

* Additions to bridge() function: can use list input for communities, improved error handling
* New argument "corMin" in goldbricker function

# networktools 1.2.0

* Three new functions for plotting networks using MDS, PCA, and eigenmodels (MDSnet, PCAnet, EIGENnet)
* Added an argument in bridge() to average bridge centrality by number of nodes in communities
